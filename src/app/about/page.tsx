              Small businesses — salons, med spas, contractors, furniture showrooms, local e-commerce brands — have always been stuck choosing between two bad options: cheap freelancers delivering generic, forgettable work, or traditional agencies charging enterprise prices for a website and a handful of ad creatives.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-mid text-lg leading-[1.8] mb-6">
              At the same time, AI tools were making it possible to design and build faster and better than ever — but almost exclusively in the hands of people charging <em>more</em> for it, not less.
            </p>
            <p className="text-ink text-xl leading-[1.8] font-medium mb-6">
              OrbitGravity exists to close that gap.

            <p className="text-gray-mid text-lg leading-[1.8]">
              We combine senior-level design and marketing judgment with AI-accelerated production, so a local business — not just a funded startup — can get a website and ad creative that actually look and perform like they belong at the top of their industry. No bloated retainers. No generic templates. Just work built specifically for your business, priced fairly, and delivered fast.

                  I started OrbitGravity after seeing how many great small businesses were being underserved online: either ignored by agencies that only wanted enterprise clients, or let down by rushed, generic freelance work. I build every project personally, using AI to move fast without cutting corners on design or strategy. If you're a small business owner who wants your online presence to actually reflect the quality of what you do — that's exactly who I built this studio for.
