Most small business projects are priced to be significantly more affordable than a traditional agency — tell us about your business and we\'ll give you a real number within 24 hours.' },
      { q: 'How long does a project take?', a: 'Most websites are built and ready to launch within 7 to 14 business days, and ad creatives typically turn around within 3–7 days, depending on scope and revisions. We\'ll give you an exact timeline once we understand your project.' },
      { q: 'Do you work with businesses outside your home country?', a: 'Yes — we work with SMBs internationally and are set up to collaborate fully remotely, including calls at time zones that work for you.' },
      { q: 'Can I see examples in my specific industry?', a: 'Likely, yes — check out our Work page, which is filterable by industry. If we don\'t have an example in your exact niche yet, we\'re happy to show comparable work and walk you through our approach.' },
      { q: "I'm not sure if I need a website, ad creative, or both — can you help me figure that out?", a: 'Absolutely — that\'s exactly what the first conversation is for. Tell us where your business is today and where you want it to go, and we\'ll recommend what will actually move the needle rather than upselling everything.' },
      { q: 'What makes OrbitGravity different from a freelancer or a big agency?', a: 'You get agency-level design thinking and AI-accelerated speed, without freelancer inconsistency or big-agency pricing and bureaucracy — one studio, directly accountable for the result.' }
